# Multi-Step Interface Implementation

## Overview

The Privacy Demo Study now features a comprehensive multi-step interface that guides users through a structured research study process. The interface follows a 4-step flow designed to ensure proper informed consent and qualification before participants engage with the main chat interface.

## Step Flow

### Step 1: Introduction Page
- **Purpose**: Welcome participants and provide study overview
- **Content**:
  - Study overview and objectives
  - What participants will do
  - Time commitment (15-20 minutes)
  - Compensation information
  - Privacy notice
- **Navigation**: "Begin Study" button → Step 2

### Step 2: Consent Page
- **Purpose**: Obtain informed consent for research participation
- **Content**:
  - Purpose of the study
  - What participants will do
  - Data collection details
  - How data will be used
  - Privacy protection measures
  - Risks and benefits
  - Voluntary participation notice
  - Contact information
- **Requirements**: Must check consent checkbox to proceed
- **Navigation**: "Back" button → Step 1, "I Consent - Continue" button → Step 3

### Step 3: Qualification Page
- **Purpose**: Ensure participants meet study requirements
- **Questions**:
  1. Are you 18 years of age or older?
  2. Do you speak and understand English fluently?
  3. Do you have experience using computers and the internet?
  4. Are you comfortable sharing some personal information for research purposes?
  5. Do you agree to complete the entire study (approximately 15-20 minutes)?
- **Requirements**: All questions must be answered "Yes" to proceed
- **Navigation**: "Back" button → Step 2, "I Qualify - Start Chat" button → Step 4

### Step 4: Chat Interface
- **Purpose**: Main study interface where participants interact with the AI chatbot
- **Features**: Original chat functionality with privacy detection and analysis
- **Navigation**: Proceeds to Prolific ID collection and then chat interaction

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
- Each step is contained in a `<div>` with class `step-page`
- Only the active step has the `active` class
- Step indicators show current progress
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### CSS Styling
- Consistent theming with existing design
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Visual feedback for form validation
- Mobile-responsive layout

### JavaScript Functionality

#### State Management
```javascript
// Multi-step interface properties in state
currentStepPage: 'introduction',
consentChecked: false,
qualificationAnswers: {
    qual1: '',
    qual2: '',
    qual3: '',
    qual4: '',
    qual5: ''
}
```

#### Key Methods
- `initializeMultiStepInterface()`: Sets up the multi-step flow
- `bindMultiStepEvents()`: Binds navigation and validation events
- `showStepPage(stepName)`: Handles step transitions
- `validateQualification()`: Validates qualification answers
- `updateMultiStepInterface()`: Updates UI state
- `saveToLocalStorage()`: Persists user progress

#### Event Handling
- Navigation buttons trigger step transitions
- Form validation prevents progression until requirements are met
- State is automatically saved to localStorage
- Visual feedback for form validation

## Features

### Progress Persistence
- User progress is automatically saved to localStorage
- Participants can return to the study and continue from where they left off
- Form responses are preserved across browser sessions

### Form Validation
- Consent checkbox must be checked to proceed
- All qualification questions must be answered "Yes"
- Real-time visual feedback for form validation
- Clear error messages and status indicators

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Touch-friendly buttons and form elements
- Adaptive spacing and typography
- Consistent experience across devices

### Accessibility
- Clear navigation structure
- Descriptive button labels
- Proper form labeling
- Keyboard navigation support

## Integration with Existing System

### Chat Interface Integration
- The original chat interface is now Step 4
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Prolific ID collection happens after qualification
- Survey and export functionality remains unchanged

### State Management
- Multi-step state is integrated with existing state management
- localStorage persistence includes multi-step progress
- Existing chat state is preserved when returning to Step 4

### API Integration
- No changes to existing API calls
- Chat functionality works as before
- Privacy detection and analysis remain unchanged

## Usage Instructions

### For Participants
1. Read the introduction and click "Begin Study"
2. Read the consent form carefully and check the consent checkbox
3. Answer all qualification questions with "Yes"
4. Enter Prolific ID when prompted
5. Proceed with the chat interaction as before

### For Researchers
- Monitor participant progress through the multi-step flow
- Ensure all consent and qualification requirements are met
- Data collection begins only after proper consent and qualification
- All existing data export functionality remains available

## Testing

A test file (`test-multistep.html`) is provided to verify the implementation:
- Checks for presence of all required elements
- Validates navigation button functionality
- Ensures form elements are properly implemented
- Confirms responsive design elements

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Ability to review previous steps
- More detailed validation messages
- Integration with external consent management systems
- Analytics tracking for step completion rates

### Customization Options
- Configurable qualification questions
- Customizable consent form content
- Flexible step ordering
- Branding and theming options

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Steps not advancing**: Check form validation requirements
2. **Progress not saving**: Verify localStorage is enabled
3. **Mobile display issues**: Test responsive design breakpoints
4. **State persistence problems**: Check localStorage quota and permissions

### Debug Information
- Console logging for step transitions
- State validation in development mode
- Error handling for localStorage failures
- Form validation feedback

## Conclusion

The multi-step interface provides a professional, compliant research study experience while maintaining all existing functionality. The implementation ensures proper informed consent and participant qualification while providing a smooth, user-friendly experience.
