# Enhanced Privacy Detection Features

## Overview

The privacy detection system has been significantly enhanced to consider conversation context when analyzing privacy risks. This addresses the limitation where individual messages were analyzed in isolation, missing cumulative privacy risks that emerge from combining information across multiple messages.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Contextual Privacy Detection

**Problem Solved**: Previously, the system only analyzed individual messages, missing privacy risks that emerge from combining information across a conversation.

**Solution**: Enhanced privacy detection now considers the entire conversation history when analyzing each message.

### 2. Improved Entity Classification

**Problem Solved**: The system was incorrectly classifying academic fields like "Computer Science" as names instead of educational records.

**Solution**: Enhanced classification rules ensure proper categorization:
- Academic fields, majors, and subjects → `EDUCATIONAL_RECORD`
- Universities and organizations → `AFFILIATION`
- Only actual person names → `NAME`

### 3. Duplicate Entity Detection

**Problem Solved**: The same entity (e.g., "Carnegie Mellon") was getting different placeholders (`[Name2]`, `[Name3]`) instead of reusing the same placeholder.

**Solution**: Implemented entity tracking system that:
- Tracks all detected entities across the conversation
- Reuses the same placeholder for duplicate entities
- Provides conversation context to the AI for better detection

#### Features:
- **Conversation Context Analysis**: Each message is analyzed in the context of previous messages
- **Cumulative Risk Detection**: Identifies when multiple pieces of information create a more complete profile
- **Contextual Risk Patterns**: Detects specific combinations that pose privacy risks

### 2. Enhanced AI Detection

The AI-based privacy detection now includes:

```javascript
// Enhanced system prompt with context awareness and entity tracking
const contextAnalysis = `
IMPORTANT: Analyze this message in the context of the entire conversation. Consider:
1. Cumulative privacy risks from combining information across multiple messages
2. Whether this message, combined with previous messages, creates a more complete profile
3. Contextual privacy issues that might not be obvious from the single message alone
4. Patterns of information sharing that could lead to identification
5. Whether this message reveals additional details about previously mentioned information

CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- "Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Engineering", etc. should be classified as EDUCATIONAL_RECORD, not NAME
- Academic fields, majors, and subjects are EDUCATIONAL_RECORD
- Only actual person names (like "John Smith", "Sarah Johnson") should be classified as NAME
- Universities and organizations (like "Carnegie Mellon", "MIT", "Google") should be classified as AFFILIATION

DUPLICATE ENTITY DETECTION: If you detect the same entity (e.g., "Carnegie Mellon") that was mentioned before, use the same placeholder number.
`;
```

#### Contextual Risk Examples:
- **Location + Company**: "I work at Google" + "I live in Mountain View" = more identifiable
- **Education + Age + Job**: "Graduated from Stanford" + "I'm 25" + "software engineer" = detailed profile

#### Entity Classification Examples:
- **Correct**: "Computer Science" → `EDUCATIONAL_RECORD`
- **Correct**: "Carnegie Mellon" → `AFFILIATION`
- **Correct**: "John Smith" → `NAME`
- **Incorrect (Fixed)**: "Computer Science" → `NAME` (was happening before)

#### Duplicate Entity Examples:
- **Before**: "Carnegie Mellon" → `[Name2]`, then "Carnegie Mellon" → `[Name3]`
- **After**: "Carnegie Mellon" → `[AFFILIATION1]`, then "Carnegie Mellon" → `[AFFILIATION1]` (same placeholder)
- **Salary + Location + Company**: "I earn $150k" + previous location/company info = financial privacy risk

### 3. Pattern-Based Contextual Detection

Enhanced pattern matching now includes contextual risk analysis:

```javascript
const contextualPatterns = [
    {
        name: 'Location + Company',
        pattern: /(?:work|job|employed|company|office).*(?:in|at|near|around).*(?:mountain view|palo alto|san francisco|new york|seattle|austin)/i,
        risk: 'Combining workplace and location information creates a more identifiable profile'
    },
    {
        name: 'Education + Age + Job',
        pattern: /(?:graduated|studied|university|college).*(?:age|years old|\d+).*(?:software engineer|developer|manager|analyst)/i,
        risk: 'Educational background combined with age and profession creates a detailed demographic profile'
    }
    // ... more patterns
];
```

### 4. Conversation-Wide Privacy Analysis

New API endpoint for comprehensive conversation analysis:

```javascript
// POST /api/conversation_privacy_analysis
{
    "conversation_history": [
        { "role": "user", "content": "...", "timestamp": "...", "step": 0 },
        { "role": "assistant", "content": "...", "timestamp": "...", "step": 1 }
    ]
}
```

#### Response includes:
- **Individual message analysis** with contextual risks
- **Conversation summary** with risk levels
- **Privacy recommendations** based on detected issues
- **Cumulative risk assessment**

### 5. Enhanced Frontend Display

The frontend now displays:

- **Contextual Risk Warnings**: Highlighted warnings for cumulative privacy risks
- **Detection Method Indicators**: Shows whether AI or pattern detection was used
- **Enhanced Privacy Analysis**: More detailed privacy issue information
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded risk levels and contextual risk warnings

## API Endpoints

### 1. Enhanced Privacy Detection
```javascript
POST /api/privacy_detection
{
    "user_message": "string"
}
// Now includes conversation context automatically
```

### 2. Conversation Privacy Analysis
```javascript
POST /api/conversation_privacy_analysis
{
    "conversation_history": [
        { "role": "user|assistant", "content": "string", "timestamp": "string", "step": number }
    ]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Log Analysis
```javascript
POST /api/analyze_log
{
    "conversation_log": [
        { "user": "string", "bot": "string" }
    ]
}
// Now uses conversation-wide analysis
```

## Response Format

### Enhanced Privacy Detection Response
```javascript
{
    "privacy_issue": boolean,
    "type": "string",
    "suggestion": "string",
    "explanation": "string",
    "severity": "high|medium|low",
    "affected_text": "string",
    "contextual_risk": "string|null",

}
```

### Conversation Analysis Response
```javascript
{
    "success": boolean,
    "analysis": {
        "conversation_analysis": [
            {
                "message_index": number,
                "message": "string",
                "privacy_result": { /* privacy detection result */ }
            }
        ],
        "summary": {
            "total_messages": number,
            "messages_with_privacy_issues": number,
            "messages_with_contextual_risks": number,

            "recommendations": ["string"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Privacy Risk Levels

### Calculation Logic
```javascript
function calculateConversationRiskLevel(totalIssues, contextualIssues, totalMessages) {
    const issuePercentage = (totalIssues / totalMessages) * 100;
    const contextualPercentage = (contextualIssues / totalMessages) * 100;

    if (contextualPercentage > 30 || issuePercentage > 50) {
        return 'HIGH';
    } else if (contextualPercentage > 15 || issuePercentage > 25) {
        return 'MEDIUM';
    } else if (issuePercentage > 0) {
        return 'LOW';
    } else {
        return 'NONE';
    }
}
```

## Contextual Risk Patterns

### 1. Location + Company Combination
- **Pattern**: Workplace information combined with specific location
- **Risk**: Creates more identifiable profile
- **Example**: "I work at Google in Mountain View"

### 2. Education + Age + Job Combination
- **Pattern**: Educational background with age and profession
- **Risk**: Detailed demographic profile
- **Example**: "Graduated from Stanford, I'm 25, software engineer"

### 3. Salary + Location + Company Combination
- **Pattern**: Financial information with location and company
- **Risk**: Significant financial privacy risk
- **Example**: "I earn $150k at Google in Mountain View"

### 4. Personal + Professional Information
- **Pattern**: Personal life details with professional information
- **Risk**: Comprehensive profile creation
- **Example**: "Married with kids, work as a manager"

## Frontend Enhancements

### 1. Contextual Risk Warning Display
```css
.contextual-risk-warning {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b, #ee5a52);
    color: white;
    padding: 12px 16px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    margin: 12px 0;
