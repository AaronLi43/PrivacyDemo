# Chatbot Question Flow Analysis - How Questions Are Asked and Follow-ups Work

## üß™ Test Overview
**Test Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Test Type**: Chatbot Question Flow Simulation  
**Session ID**: test-question-flow-1754944865527  
**Target**: http://localhost:3000/api/chat  

## üîç Chatbot Question-Asking Behavior Analysis

### **1. üöÄ Conversation Initialization**
- **Entry Point**: Chatbot starts with a warm, contextual opening question
- **First Question**: "What did you major in during your college or university studies, and what drew you to that field?"
- **Behavior**: Chatbot immediately engages with relevant, personal questions
- **Tone**: Warm, curious, and conversational

### **2. üìù Question Progression Pattern**
The chatbot follows a **smart progression system**:

```
Background Question ‚Üí User Answer ‚Üí Audit ‚Üí Follow-up OR Next Question
```

**Example Flow:**
1. **Background Q**: "What did you major in...?"
2. **User Answer**: [Educational background response]
3. **Audit Result**: Response needs more detail
4. **Follow-up Q**: "What initially sparked your interest in AI/ML?"
5. **User Answer**: [Follow-up response]
6. **Audit Result**: Still needs more detail
7. **Second Follow-up**: "What specific project or experience sparked your interest?"
8. **Progression**: Moves to next main question

### **3. üîÑ Follow-up Question Generation**

#### **When Follow-ups Are Generated:**
- **Audit Verdict**: `REQUIRE_MORE` (response incomplete)
- **Response Quality**: Lacks specific details or examples
- **Context Need**: Requires more information before proceeding

#### **Follow-up Question Characteristics:**
- **Contextual**: Based on the user's previous response
- **Specific**: Ask for concrete examples or details
- **Progressive**: Build upon previous answers
- **Natural**: Flow conversationally, not mechanically

#### **Examples of Generated Follow-ups:**
1. **Original Q**: "What did you major in?"
   - **Follow-up**: "What initially sparked your interest in AI/ML?"
   - **Second Follow-up**: "What specific project or experience sparked your interest?"

2. **Original Q**: "Can you walk me through using GenAI for interview prep?"
   - **Follow-up**: "What actions did you take and what was the outcome?"

3. **Original Q**: "What tasks did you rely on GenAI for?"
   - **Follow-up**: "What specific tasks did you find GenAI most helpful for?"

### **4. üìã Main Question Progression**

#### **Question Flow Structure:**
```
Background Phase ‚Üí Main Questions ‚Üí Follow-ups ‚Üí Next Main Question
```

#### **Progression Logic:**
- **Step Advancement**: Each question advances the step counter
- **Audit-Driven**: Questions only advance when audit passes
- **Follow-up Integration**: Follow-ups are part of the same step
- **Natural Flow**: Smooth transition between question types

#### **Main Questions Asked:**
1. **Question 1**: "Can you walk me through a specific time when you used GenAI to help prepare for a job interview?"
2. **Question 2**: "What kinds of tasks did you find yourself relying on GenAI for most when preparing for interviews?"
3. **Question 3**: "Have you ever considered or actually used GenAI during a live interview? What happened?"

### **5. üéØ Audit System Integration**

#### **Audit Verdicts Observed:**
- **`REQUIRE_MORE`**: Triggers follow-up questions
- **`ALLOW_NEXT_QUESTION`**: Allows progression to next question

#### **Audit-Driven Flow Control:**
```
User Response ‚Üí Audit Assessment ‚Üí Verdict ‚Üí Action
     ‚Üì
REQUIRE_MORE ‚Üí Generate Follow-up Question
     ‚Üì
ALLOW_NEXT_QUESTION ‚Üí Move to Next Main Question
```

### **6. ü§ñ Chatbot Intelligence Features**
