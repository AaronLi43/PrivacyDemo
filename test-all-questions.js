            5: "Yes, AI was definitely a game-changer for my interview prep. It helped me understand complex algorithms much faster than studying alone.",
            6: "I relied on AI mostly for coding practice, algorithm explanations, and mock interview questions. It was especially helpful for system design questions.",
            7: "I saved some particularly good AI-generated explanations for common algorithms like dynamic programming and graph traversal.",

            16: "Looking back, I think using AI to generate entire solutions crossed a line. I should have used it more for learning than for answers.",
            17: "AI backfired when I used a solution I didn't fully understand. The interviewer asked follow-up questions I couldn't answer.",
            18: "I draw the line at using AI to understand concepts versus using it to generate complete solutions. Learning is okay, copying is not.",
            19: "My friends and I have had long discussions about this. Most think using AI for learning is fine, but using it during interviews is cheating.",
